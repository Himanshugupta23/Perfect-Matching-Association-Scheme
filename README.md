# Perfect Matching Association Scheme - Eigenvalues via Srinivasan Algorithm

This repository contains SageMath and Jupyter implementations of the recursive algorithm described by:

**M. K. Srinivasan, "The perfect matching association scheme", Algebraic Combinatorics 3 (2020), 559–591.**  
The original Maple implementation is available [here](https://www.math.iitb.ac.in/~mks/papers/EigenMatch.pdf).

These scripts were used to **compute eigenvalues of the graphs in the perfect matching association scheme** and to verify conjectures from our manuscript:

**H. Gupta, A. Herman, A. Lacaze-Masmonteil, R. Maleki, and K. Meagher, "On the second largest eigenvalue of certain graphs in the perfect matching association scheme" (2025+).**
